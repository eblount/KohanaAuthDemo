KohanaAuthDemo
==============

This demo Kohana app shows how to use the latest version of UserAdmin: https://github.com/eblount/useradmin

It also includes my Kohana module to theme Useradmin using Twitter Bootstrap, and it shows how to easily use an additional field added to the users table (name).

Feel free to use this application as an example, or to fork it and use it as a base for other applications (which is what I plan to do).
